Description
Suppose you have just joined a team responsible for developing an Email Audit system. Assume that this project is a real project and is being used in a production environment on a trial basis (since the features are not yet complete).

You are tasked with implementing a component called RecipientsDisplay, to intelligently show email recipients in the AuditTable component.

You may choose any one of the frameworks to implement the RecipientsDisplay component. The requirements are specified in CHALLENGE.md inside the challenge_details directory. Please note that you are not allowed to modify any other file (including adding new packages) to complete this mission.
